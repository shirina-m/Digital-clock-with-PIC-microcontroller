# ðŸ•’ Digital Clock with Full Control using PIC16F877A & DS1307

This project implements a **24-hour format digital clock** with full time-setting capabilities using the **PIC16F877A microcontroller** and a **DS1307 Real-Time Clock (RTC) module**. The time is displayed in real-time on an LCD screen and can be adjusted via buttons connected to the microcontroller.

## ðŸ§° Components Used

- PIC16F877A Microcontroller  
- DS1307 RTC Module  
- LCD (16x2) Display  
- 8 MHz Crystal Oscillator  
- 2x 22pF Capacitors  
- 10kÎ© Potentiometer (for LCD contrast)  
- Pull-up Resistors  
- Push Buttons (Hour & Minute adjustment)

## ðŸ§ª Simulation (Proteus)

The project was first simulated using **Proteus**, showing correct interfacing of:

- PIC16F877A and DS1307 via software I2C
- LCD displaying real-time clock (HH:MM:SS)
- Pull-up resistors for stable communication with the RTC

## ðŸ’» Code (MikroC)

The code is written in **MikroC for PIC**, utilizing:

- Software IÂ²C to communicate with the DS1307
- LCD control using 4-bit mode
- Button-driven time adjustment
- Real-time clock reading and display logic

### Key Features:
- âœ… 24-hour format
- âœ… Increment hours/minutes using RD0/RD1 buttons
- âœ… Debounced button logic
- âœ… Real-time synchronization with DS1307
- âœ… Displays `DIGITAL CLOCK` and live time on 16x2 LCD

## ðŸ”§ Hardware Setup (Breadboard)

The project was successfully tested on a breadboard with:

- LCD connected to PORTB
- DS1307 connected via RC3 (SCL) and RC4 (SDA)
- Buttons connected to RD0 (Hour+) and RD1 (Minute+)
- Pull-up resistors used on I2C lines
